# CoRE Lab

“CoRE” stands for Computing, Reasoning, and Expression. 

We explore how **computing practices** (e.g., programming, data analysis and visualization, computer simulation, GIS mapping) are changing the ways that young people learn and communicate about our world.

Check out our current projects:

* [Rivulet](https://github.com/CalCoRE/rivulet-utils) : Python notebook API utilities to curate & fetch pedagogically generative data
* [DSE-citan](https://github.com/CalCoRE/dse-citan) : A citation analysis of "Data Science Education" literature
* [How to Choosy](https://github.com/CalCoRE/how-to-choosy) : Tools and strategies to wrangle "Goldilocks" datasets
