# CoRE Lab

“CoRE” stands for Computing, Reasoning, and Expression. 

We explore how *computing practices* (e.g., programming, data analysis and visualization, computer simulation, GIS mapping) are changing the ways that young people learn and communicate about our world.

To do so, we bring together perspectives from the Learning Sciences, STEM Education, and Digital and Multimodal Literacies. Our research and design is done in partnership with educators and community organizations, with the shared goal of teaching scientific computing in ways that are *ethical, equitable, and expressive*.
